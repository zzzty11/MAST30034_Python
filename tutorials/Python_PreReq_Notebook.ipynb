    "## `git` (GitHub) Summary\n",
    "_Whilst this should have been covered in prerequisite subjects, a refresher may be in order_. For this subject, the minimal requirement for `git` is:\n",
    "1. `clone`: copy an existing repo from remote (repository) into your local destination.\n",
    "2. Publishing new changes:\n",
    "  - `add` + `commit`: create a new snapshot of the local repository and commit the changes.\n",
    "  - `push`: upload your local commits to remote.\n",
    "3. Syncing unseen changes:\n",
    "  - `fetch`: download unseen commits from remote to local.\n",
    "  - `merge`: merge the commits from remote with changes in local.\n",
    "    - If local has no new changes (or `is up to date`), the merge does not create new snapshot.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, changes will be automatically merged if there is no *conflict*, else you need to resolve the conflict. You will need to `commit` the merge result once this process finishes.\n",
    "      - Question: After `merge`, is the local and remote now synced? Why or why not?\n",
    "  - `pull`: Shorthand for chaining `fetch` and `merge`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Graphical illustration:\n",
    "![gitoverview](../media/git-process.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Authentication:\n",
    "  - For GitHub, [Personal Access Tokens (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required as a security measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Desktop\n",
    "GitHub Desktop hides lots of the process under-the-hood. It is good for those who are not familiar with `git` and honestly, we use it for industry work because its easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloning:** \n",
    "1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)\n",
    "2. Login with your credentials\n",
    "3. On the top-left menu, click on `Add` -> `Clone repository...`\n",
    "4. Enter https://github.com/liamhodg/MAST30034_Python as the URL\n",
    "5. Click on `Clone`.\n",
    "6. Done!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publishing:**\n",
    "1. Add changes.\n",
    "2. Click on the `MAST30034_Python` repo.\n",
    "3. Add a summary (i.e `\"removed incorrect transformation for xyz\"`)\n",
    "4. Commit to `main` (or your specified `branch` if you know what it is)\n",
    "5. Push, and you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syncing:**\n",
    "1. Click on the `MAST30034_Python` repo.\n",
    "2. Click `Fetch origin` (refresh icon)\n",
    "3. Pull, and you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git` CLI (Command Line Interface)\n",
    "If you are using `git` CLI, you will need PAT:\n",
    "1. Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens \n",
    "2. Generate a token (set it to expire end of this semester).\n",
    "3. Add changes and commit as usual.\n",
    "4. Now, after adding your `username`, you will be prompted with `password`. Rather than using your GitHub password, you should use your generated PAT here.\n",
    "5. Done!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloning:** \n",
    "1. Open a terminal (yes it is commandline `git` for this to work).\n",
    "2. `git clone HTTPS` (where HTTPS is the https url to your gitlab repo).\n",
    "3. Enter your credentials (with PAT).\n",
    "4. Done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Publishing:** \n",
    "1. Change directories to inside your repository (`cd NAME_OF_REPO_FOLDER`).\n",
    "2. `git add -A` (this will stage all changed/untracked files files for the next commit, ignored files are excepted). You can use `git status` to track changed files before adding.\n",
    "3. `git commit -m \"message\"` (make a commit with a message).\n",
    "5. `git push`\n",
    "6. Enter your credentials.\n",
    "    - Here, use the same username\n",
    "    - BUT, instead of your password, use the PAT you generated.\n",
    "7. Done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syncing:** \n",
    "1. Change directories to inside your repository (`cd NAME_OF_REPO_FOLDER`).\n",
    "2. `git pull`\n",
    "3. Done."
